			<h2><center>Who am I</center></h2>
			<div class="justify-text">&nbsp&nbspI am Anny, a writer, reader, and enterprenuer. I'm a student in the Unversity of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria. I stand as a beacon of creativity and light, inspiring all who encounter me to embrace the beauty of story telling. My love for reading is akin to a flame that never dims, devouring books with an insatiable hunger for knowledge and inspiration. Each page turned is a journey embarked upon, each word a treasure unearthed, as i delves into the realms of fantasy, romance, and mystery, seeking solace and adventure within the confines of ink and paper.<br>
			&nbsp&nbspIt was in the act of writing that I found my true calling, my voice echoing through the corridors of literature with a resonance that is uniquely my own. Whether penning poetry that dances with the rhythm of my heart or crafting narratives that transport reader to far-off lands, I imbues my words with a sincerity and depth that leave an indelible mark upon the soul. Yet beyond my writing my wpirit finds expression in the melody of song.</div>
